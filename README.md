# Solar System Simulation
A basic simulation of a unary star system using Multithreading and User Interface elements. The solar system allows a user to add any star, planet(s), and satellite(s) the user wants. 

## How to run the simulation

Clone this repository to a directory on your computer. Then, go to the src subdirectory.
To compile on terminal, type "javac SolarSystemSim.java" and to run, type "java SolarSystemSim"

Once the simulation is running, read the first pop-up message carefully. It contains useful information that will make your experience easier. 

Additionally, this simulation uses multiple cores, so having too many background processes running simultaneously may hinder the speed of the simulation. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java downloaded on your computer. Installing the latest version of Java may help to avoid possible issues with compilation and running. To install Java, go to https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and follow the instructions provided.
