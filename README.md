# Solar System Simulation
A basic simulation of a star system using Multithreading and User Interface elements. The solar system allows a user to add any star, planet(s), and satellite(s) the user wishes. 

## How to run the simulation

Clone this repository to a directory on your computer. Once that is done go to the src subdirectory.
To compile, type "javac SolarSystemSim.java" and to run, type "java SolarSystemSim"

Once the simulation is running, read the first pop-up message carefully. It contains useful information that will make your experience easier. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java downloaded on your computer. I recommend installing the latest version of Java.
